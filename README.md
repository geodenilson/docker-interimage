# A Docker image for InterIMAGE

This Dockerfile is based on the InterIMAGE installation instructions on Ubuntu: http://www.lvc.ele.puc-rio.br/projects/interimage/download/files/install_interimage_ubuntu.txt

To run the container, install Docker and open a command prompt in the directory `/1.27`. Then build the container with

`docker build -t interimage .`

and start it with

`docker run -it --user interimage interimage`

(To remove the image directly after, add the `--rm` flag.)

This opens a bash prompt. Interimage is can be started with the following command (the image should start in the directory `cd /home/interimage/InterIMAGE_Source_1.27/bin`, if not, cd there).

```
./interimage
```


## Development

* `docker build .`
* `docker run -it --rm <imageid>`


## Image content

The image has a user `interimage` which should be used to run analysis in the container if you have security considerations.

The downloads and built libraries are in the directory `home/interimage`:
